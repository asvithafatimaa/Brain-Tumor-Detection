# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain tumor classification is a critical application of medical image analysis using deep learning and artificial intelligence. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify brain tumors from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans into different categories.
